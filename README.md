# IMG-UPLOADER

This is a simpe image uploader demo using a Spring Boot backend and Angular in the frontend and Tailwind CSS. It's a practical implementation of an article I read on Medium for uploading images with Spring Boot. I added the frontend part along with the `get images` endpoint. 

This app allows uploading images and displays all the uploaded images in a grid at the bottom.
